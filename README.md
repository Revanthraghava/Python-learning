# Python Journey

This repository documents my daily Python practice,
focused on building strong fundamentals through
practical programs and projects.
Each folder represents a learning milestone with
working code and incremental improvements.

## Day 4 – Score Analyzer

Concepts practiced:
- Lists
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- Edge case handling

Project:
- A program that collects multiple scores,
  calculates total, average, highest and lowest values,
  and outputs a Pass/Fail result.

  ## Day 5 – Score Categorizer
- Categorized scores using conditions inside loops
- Counted pass/fail cases
- Calculated percentages
- Handled empty input safely

  ## Day 8 – Expense Analyzer

Built a console-based Expense Analyzer to apply problem-solving skills to a real-world scenario.

### Features
- Collects multiple expense values from user input
- Uses functions to separate data collection and analysis
- Calculates:
  - total number of expenses
  - highest expense
  - lowest expense
  - average expense
- Handles empty input safely without errors

### Concepts Used
- Lists
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- Functions with multiple return values
- Clean data flow without global variables
