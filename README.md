# Python Journey

This repository documents my daily Python practice,
focused on building strong fundamentals through
practical programs and projects.
Each folder represents a learning milestone with
working code and incremental improvements.

## 1. Score Analyzer

Concepts practiced:
- Lists
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- Edge case handling

Project:
- A program that collects multiple scores,
  calculates total, average, highest and lowest values,
  and outputs a Pass/Fail result.

  ## 2. Score Categorizer
- Categorized scores using conditions inside loops
- Counted pass/fail cases
- Calculated percentages
- Handled empty input safely

  ## 3. Expense Analyzer

Built a console-based Expense Analyzer to apply problem-solving skills to a real-world scenario.

### Features
- Collects multiple expense values from user input
- Uses functions to separate data collection and analysis
- Calculates:
  - total number of expenses
  - highest expense
  - lowest expense
  - average expense
- Handles empty input safely without errors

### Concepts Used
- Lists
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- Functions with multiple return values
- Clean data flow without global variables
  

## 4. Score Frequency Analyzer
- Categorizes student scores into distinction, pass, and fail
- Calculates percentage distribution
- Handles edge cases safely
- Built using functions and clean control flow

## Expense Analyzer
- Tracks user expenses
- Calculates total, highest, lowest, and average values
- Designed with modular functions
